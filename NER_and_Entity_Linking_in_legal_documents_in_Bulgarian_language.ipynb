This type of annotation has been proposed for the first time at CoNLL-2003 dataset created for NER (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). There are other tag notation types. For instance, each token can be predicted with a tag indicated by B-(begin), I-(inside), E-(end), S-(singleton) of a named entity with its type, or O-(outside) of named entities.

For Bulgarian language generally such data could be available if we start scraping web pages, which is huge amount of work. The problem afterwards is hidden in the effectiveness of the model created itself. Luckily, after the publication of the famous paper called \"Attention is all you need\" by Vaswani and the \"appearance\" of *Transformer*, there is a huge advancement compared to previous usage of recurrence (RNN), Bidirectional Lont-Short Term Memory units (BiLSTM), convolutions (CNN) and CRF. Transformer utilizes stacked self-attention and pointwise, fully connected layers to build basic blocks for encoder and decoder.  Experiments on various tasks show Transformers to be superior in quality while requiring significantly less time to train.\r\n",

Using such models, sequence tagging tasks are often approached one sentence at a time, essentially discarding any information available in the broader surrounding context, and there is only little recent study on the use of cross-sentence context – sentences around the sentence of interest – to improve sequence tagging performance.\r\n",

BERT uses a fixed-size window that limits the amount of text that can be input to the model at one time. The model maximum window size, or maximum sequence length, is fixed during pre-training, with 512 wordpieces a common choice. This window fits dozens of typical sentences of input at a time, allowing the inclusion of extensive sentence context."
